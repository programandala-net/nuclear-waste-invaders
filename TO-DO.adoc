Older first:

== 2016-08-01

- Several players, say 1..4. Simply, save their controls number and
  score in a table.

== 2016-10-16, 2018-01-07

- Effect: the invaders eat the containers.

== 2016-10-22

- Detect if a wall is already broken, and change the graphic
  accordingly.

== 2017-02-28, 2017-12-19

- Make a hit invader randomly move up to the next layer, if it's free.

== 2017-03-17, 2018-02-17

- Create a sprite frames table to point to UDG frames, in order to
  remove duplicated frames.

== 2017-04-18

- Write Z80 code to print 2x1 sprites faster.

== 2017-05-16

- Improve `battle-bonus`: Make the breach penalty depend on the
  altitude of the breaches.

== 2017-12-06

- Make `defeat-tune` an alarm and use it when an alien touches the
  wall.

== 2017-12-18, 2018-02-17

- Improve scoring: reduce the score with each lost projectile.
- Move the localization tools to Solo Forth.

== 2017-12-19

- Make the mothership cure invaders.

== 2017-12-22

- Make launching the beam a bit random.
- Place the mothership above the building for repairing.

== 2018-01-03

- Finish regularizing the names of the sprites. The static graphics
  have no suffix.

== 2018-01-08

- Improve the graphics of the explosion.

== 2018-01-10, 2018-02-17

- Make sound of mothership explosion longer. Manage it in
  `exploding-mothership-action`.
- Idea: Make `manage-mothership` deferred, replacing
  `mothership-action`, and duplicate its current functions
  (checking, timing and scheduling) into every action.  This will be a
  bit faster, saving one nesting level.

== 2018-01-21, 2018-02-02

- Improve the logic of `(invader-impacted`: First `wounded`, then
  `mortal?`. But make the wound a bit random: otherwise the green
  invaders will never explode.

== 2018-01-22, 2018-02-02

- Add sound effect to arm toggling.
- Reduce the range of the mothership.

== 2018-01-24

- Reduce the fields that hold frame counts in the species structure.

== 2018-01-26

- Rename invader data fields with prefix `~invader-`.
- Rename species data fields with prefix `~species-`.
- When a ball hits an invader, color the invader blue and halt it for
  a while.
- Improve the sprites of the wall balls.
- Improve repairing of the breaches with an effect done by an
  independent action.

== 2018-02-02

- Fix: no explosion sound when stamina becomes 1?

== 2018-02-06

- Improve projectile explosions with sequential frames.
- Improve projectile explosions with specific sprites for every type.

== 2018-02-08

- Replace `+invaders` with a real-time counter.
- Make `(new-mothership-x-inc` faster. Maybe calculate the weight of
  invaders at both sides with one single loop.
- Allow only one flying missile.
- Reduce altitude of bullets below the top invader.

== 2018-02-15

- Erode the wall in `?<break-wall` and `?break-wall>`. Problem: the
  wall attribute should be red on black instead of red on white...

== 2018-02-16

- Rename "start-breaking-the-wall" "start-breaking", or
  "try-break-wall".
- Replace the flag variable `mothership-stopped` with deferring of
  `?stop-mothership`. This change will save time during the movement
  of the mothership; the changing of the status will take longer than
  `on` and `off`, but it is needed only in `stop-mothership` and
  `mothership-turns-back`. The code will be less clear, though.

== 2018-02-17

- Improve the effect of projectiles: make the damage cumulative. For
  example, use a 0..100 stamina range and make any impact reduce it.
- Add the current gun to `(new-mothership-x-inc`, combined with
  `missiles-left`? I.e., if the current gun is other than the missile
  gun, reduce the weight of the ammo in the calculation.
- Rename suffix "-udg" "-udga", for clarity.
