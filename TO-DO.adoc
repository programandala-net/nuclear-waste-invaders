Older first:

== 2016-08-01

- Several players, say 1..4. Simply, save their controls number and
  score in a table.

== 2016-10-16, 2018-01-07

- Effect: the invaders eat the containers.

== 2016-10-22

- Detect if a wall is already broken, and change the graphic
  accordingly.

== 2017-02-28, 2017-12-19

- Make a hit invader randomly move up to the next layer, if it's free.

== 2017-03-17, 2018-02-17

- Create a sprite frames table to point to UDG frames, in order to
  remove duplicated frames.

== 2017-04-18

- Write Z80 code to print 2x1 sprites faster.

== 2017-05-16

- Improve `battle-bonus`: Make the breach penalty depend on the
  altitude of the breaches.

== 2017-12-06

- Make `defeat-tune` an alarm and use it when an alien touches the
  wall.

== 2017-12-18, 2018-02-17

- Move the localization tools to Solo Forth.

== 2017-12-19

- Make the mothership cure invaders.

== 2017-12-22

- Make launching the beam a bit random.
- Place the mothership above the building for repairing.

== 2018-01-03

- Finish regularizing the names of the sprites. The static graphics
  have no suffix.

== 2018-01-08

- Improve the graphics of the explosion.

== 2018-01-10, 2018-02-17

- Make sound of mothership explosion longer. Manage it in
  `exploding-mothership-action`.
- Idea: Make `manage-mothership` deferred, replacing
  `mothership-action`, and duplicate its current functions
  (checking, timing and scheduling) into every action.  This will be a
  bit faster, saving one nesting level.

== 2018-01-21, 2018-02-02

- Improve the logic of `(invader-impacted`: First `wounded`, then
  `mortal?`. But make the wound a bit random: otherwise the green
  invaders will never explode.

== 2018-01-22, 2018-02-02

- Add sound effect to arm toggling.
- Reduce the range of the mothership.

== 2018-01-26

- Improve the sprites of the wall balls.
- Improve repairing of the breaches with an effect done by an
  independent action.

== 2018-02-06

- Improve projectile explosions with sequential frames.
- Improve projectile explosions with specific sprites for every type.

== 2018-02-08

- Replace `+invaders` with a real-time counter.
- Make `(new-mothership-x-inc` faster. Maybe calculate the weight of
  invaders at both sides with one single loop.
- Allow only one flying missile.
- Reduce altitude of bullets below the top invader.

== 2018-02-16

- Replace the flag variable `mothership-stopped` with deferring of
  `?stop-mothership`. This change will save time during the movement
  of the mothership; the changing of the status will take longer than
  `on` and `off`, but it is needed only in `stop-mothership` and
  `mothership-turns-back`. The code will be less clear, though.

== 2018-02-17

- Improve the effect of projectiles: make the damage cumulative. For
  example, use a 0..100 stamina range and make any impact reduce it.
  Now impacts have no effect on next impacts.
- Make invaders become motherships inside the building, after eating a
  container. But how they go out? Simple option: Destroy only half
  container, then do the metamorphosis with an independent action, and
  finally try to exit through the same breach. Other invaders should
  dodge the mothership during the ascending.

== 2018-02-23

- Improve: When a balled invader is hit by a ball, reduce its chances
  to unball in `balled-invader-action`.
- Improve: When a balled invader is hit by a missile or bullet and
  it does not explode, keep it balled.
- Change the language of titles and reports at run-time, using the
  key used in the main menu.

== 2018-02-25

- Remove invader layers. Use only the rows.

== 2018-02-27

- Make only green and yellow invaders erode the wall, and use their
  color for the eroded brick.
- Make red invaders retreat as soon as possible, e.g. when they are
  flying towards the building because of a dodged projectile.

== 2018-03-01

- Add debugging `cont` to jump into `fight`.

== 2018-03-02

- Rewrite `erode-brick` with an attributeless version of `emit-udga`,
  say `dump-udga`, for speed.
- Fix: the system crashes when a newly recharged ball is shoot. This
  bug was introduced with the recharging system, in version 0.186.0.

== 2018-04-18, 2018-04-30

Fix: More than two flying balls crash the system. It seems the origin
is the implementation of recharging:

In versions 0.186.0 and 0.186.1 the system crashes when balls are
recharged; in version 0.187.0, which limited the number of
projectiles, the system crashes when three balls are flying.  Same
problem with missiles. Bullets don't cause trouble because they are
too fast to be recharged beyond their limit.
