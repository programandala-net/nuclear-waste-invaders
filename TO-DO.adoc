Older first:

== 2016-08-01

Several players, say 1..4. Simply, save their controls number and score in a
table.

== 2016-10-12

Use pixels instead of characters as projectiles.

== 2016-10-15

Show a graphic of the ammo left.

== 2016-10-16

Effect: the invaders eat the containers.

Keep moving the projectiles and the invaders after the invasion,
during the future final effect.

Change the color of explosions.

Animate the explosions with several frames.

== 2016-10-22

Detect if a wall is already broken, and change the graphic
accordingly.

== 2016-12-02

Fix: sometimes the projectile erases half of the invader.

== 2016-12-04, 2017-05-17

Use stamina to calculate the damages to the mothership.

== 2017-02-26, 2017-05-14

Max ammo, with a method or place to get more.

Get more ammo by firing below the building.

== 2017-02-26

Make the building touch the ground. Then make the tank invisible when
it moves inside the building.

== 2017-02-28

- Make the tank delay through the doors.
- Make a hit invader randomly move up to the next layer, if it's free.

== 2017-01-13

Improve the visibility of the projectile right above the tank.

== 2017-03-01

- Now two data fields are used for the invader status: `~active` and
  `~retreating`.  Use only one datum instead, to hold the identifier
  of the current status (attacking, docked, breaking the wall,
  retreating...). This will be simpler to use and more versatile.
- Change the graphics of the invaders that are delayed at the wall.

== 2017-03-01

Add some inertia to the tank.

== 2017-03-17

Create a sprite frames table to point to UDG frames, in order to
remove duplicated frames from the UDG set.

== 2017-04-18

- Write Z80 code to print 2x1 sprites faster.
- Simplify the status bar, remove the texts, display only "0000/0000".

== 2017-05-12

- Don't repair the building automatically. Use the tank.
- Improve the start of the attack: Make the mothership drop the
  invaders.

== 2017-05-16

Improve `battle-bonus`: Make the breach penalty depend on the altitude
of the breachs.

== 2017-05-20

Replace the UDG codes with the UDG addresses and write a new faster
version of `.2x1sprite`, in Z80, without the conversion from code to
address.

== 2017-05-21

Improve the explosion of the mothership. Now it's almost unobservable.

Possible method to make the explosion longer without halting the game
loop:

- Change its graphic to a sequence of explosion frames.
- Change its x coordinate increment to 0.
- Update its detection accordingly.
- Change its y coordinate to zero only when the explosion has
  finished.

== 2017-12-06

- Make `defeat-tune` an alarm and use it when an alien touches the
  wall.
- If the mothership is visible wait until it's gone before displaying
  the attack report.
- Make the tank chains move, use two or three graphics.
- Fix: the mothership still moves faster when there are few invaders.
- Improve: make the mothership halt and change direction above the
  building, randomly.
