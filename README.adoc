== How to compile and run

. Make sure the required programs, listed in the header of the
  <Makefile> file, are installed on your system.
. Type `make` in the project directory to build the
  <disk_2_nuclear_waste_invaders.mgt> disk image and the
  <landscapes.compressed.tap> tape image.
. Start a ZX Spectrum 128 emulator with the Plus D interface.
. Enter 128 BASIC.
. Insert the Solo Forth's <disk_0_boot.mgt> disk image into drive 1.
. Type `run` to load G+DOS and Solo Forth from drive 1.
. Insert the <disk_2_nuclear_invaders.mgt> disk image into drive 1.
. Open the <landscapes.compressed.tape.tap> tape image as input tape.
. Type `1 load` to load block 1 from the current drive. This will
  start the compilation. Messages will be shown during the process.
. Set your emulator to its maximum speed and wait. When the
  compilation is finished, the screen is cleared and a message is
  displayed.
. Type `run` to start the game.
. Save a SZX snapshot with your emulator.
